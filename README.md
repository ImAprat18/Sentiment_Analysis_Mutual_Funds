# Sentiment_Analysis_Mutual_Funds
A project to analyze the effect of general news on Net Asset Value (NAV) of mutual funds.
The repository consists of the data used in the project. There are two files:
1. sentiment_analysis.ipynb: This contains the code to pull news headlines from The Economic Times along with sentiment scores from the VADER lexicon.
2. ml_model.ipynb: This combines sentiment data with Sensex data and fits various models to the dataset.

The mutual fund under consideration is the SBI Blue Chip Fund - Regular - Growth Plan. Users can use NAV data from any mutual fund, available on the AMFI website.

The project aimed to analyze the impact of general news headlines on mutual funds. Further details and conclusions as well as scope for improvement are mentioned in the ml_model.ipynb notebook.
